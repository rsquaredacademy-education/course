## Introduction

In this post, we will learn about using regular expressions in R. While it is 
aimed at absolute beginners, we hope experienced users will find it useful as 
well. The post is broadly divided into 3 sections. In the first section, we 
will introduce the pattern matching functions such as `grep`, `grepl` etc. in 
base R as we will be using them in the rest of the post. Once the reader is 
comfortable with the above mentioned pattern matching functions, we will 
learn about regular expressions while exploring the names of R packages by 
probing the following:

- how many package names include the letter `r`?
- how many package names begin or end with the letter `r`?
- how many package names include the words `data` or `plot`?

In the final section, we will go through 4 case studies including simple email
validation. If you plan to try the case studies, please do not skip any of the
topics in the second section. 

## Quantifiers

Quantifiers are very powerful and we need to be careful while using them. They 
always act on items to the immediate left and are used to specify the number of
times a pattern must appear or be matched. The below table shows the different
quantifiers and their description:

```{r regex_quantifiers, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifiers.png")
```

```{r top_downloads, echo=FALSE}
top_downloads <- c("devtools", "rlang", "dplyr", "Rcpp", "tibble",    
                   "ggplot2", "glue", "pillar", "cli", "data.table")

top_downloads
```

#### Dot

The `.` (dot) is a wildcard character as it will match any character except a 
new line (\n). Keep in mind that it will match only 1 character and if you want 
to match more than 1 character, you need to specify as many dots. Let us look 
at a few examples.

```{r quantifier_dot, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_dot_canva.png")
```

```{r read_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_csv("package_names.csv") %>%
  pull(1) -> r_packages 
```


```{r quantifier_dot_code_1}
# extract package names that include the string data 
data_pkgs <- grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "data", value = TRUE)
head(data_pkgs)

# package name includes the string data followed by any character and then the letter r
grep(x = data_pkgs, pattern = "data.r", value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)

# package name includes the string data followed by any 3 characters and then the letter r
grep(x = data_pkgs, pattern = "data...r", value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)

# package name includes the string data followed by any 3 characters and then the letter r
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "data(.){3}r", value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)

# package name includes the string stat followed by any 2 characters and then the letter r
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "stat..r", value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

#### Optional Character

`?`, the optional character is used when the item to its left is optional and 
is matched at most once.

```{r regex_optional, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_optional.png")
``` 

In this first example, we are looking for package names that include the 
following pattern:

- includes the letter `r`
- includes the string `data`
- there may be zero or one character between `r` and `data`

```{r quantifier_mark_1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_question_mark.png")
```

```{r quantifier_question_code_1}
grep(x = data_pkgs, pattern = "r(.)?data", value = TRUE)
```

In the below example, we are looking for package names that include the 
following pattern:

- includes the letter `r`
- includes the string `data`
- there may be zero or one dot between `r` and `data`

```{r quantifier_mark_2, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_question_mark_2.png")
```

```{r quantifier_question_code_2}
grep(x = data_pkgs, pattern = "r(\\.)?data", value = TRUE)
```

In the next example, we are looking for package names that include the 
following pattern:

- includes the letter `r`
- includes the string `data`
- there may be zero or one character between `r` and `data`
- and the character must be any of the following:
    - m
    - y
    - q

```{r quantifier_mark_3, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_question_mark_3.png")
```

```{r quantifier_question_code_3}
grep(x = data_pkgs, pattern = "r(m|y|q)?data", value = TRUE)
```

In the last example, we are looking for package names that include the 
following pattern:

- includes the letter `r`
- includes the string `data`
- there may be zero or one character between `r` and `data`
- and the character must be any of the following:
    - m
    - y
    - q
    - dot

```{r quantifier_mark_4, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_question_mark_4.png")
```

```{r quantifier_question_code_4}
grep(x = data_pkgs, pattern = "r(\\.|m|y|q)?data", value = TRUE)
```

#### Asterik Symbol

`*`, the asterik symbol is used when the item to its left will be matched zero 
or more times.

```{r regex_asterik, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_asterik.png")
```

In the below example, we are looking for package names that include the 
following pattern:

- includes the letter `r`
- includes the string `data`
- there may be zero or more character(s) between `r` and `data`

```{r quantifier_star, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_star.png")
```

```{r quantifier_star_code}
grep(x = data_pkgs, pattern = "r(.)*data", value = TRUE)
```

#### Plus Symbol

`+`, the plus symbol is used when the item to its left is matched one or more 
times.

```{r regex_plus, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_plus.png")
```

In the below example, we are looking for package names that include the 
following pattern:

- includes the string `plot`
- `plot` is preceded by one or more `g`

```{r quantifier_plus, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_plus.png")
```

```{r quantifier_plus_code}
plot_pkgs <- grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "plot", value = TRUE)
grep(x = plot_pkgs, pattern = "(g)+plot", value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

## Brackets

```{r regex_brackets, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_brackets.png")
```

#### {n}

`{n}` is used when the item to its left is matched exactly n times. In the 
below example, we are looking for package names that include the following 
pattern:

- includes the string `plot`
- `plot` is preceded by exactly one `g`

```{r quantifier_exact_n_match, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_exact_n_match_canva.png")
```

```{r quantifier_n_code}
grep(x = plot_pkgs, pattern = "(g){2}plot", value = TRUE)
```

#### {n,}

`{n, }` is used when the item to its left is matched n or more times. In the 
below example, we are looking for package names that include the following 
pattern:

- includes the string `plot`
- `plot` is preceded by one or more `g`

```{r quantifier_match_one_or_more, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_match_one_or_more_canva.png")
```

```{r quantifier_n_or_more_code}
grep(x = plot_pkgs, pattern = "(g){1, }plot", value = TRUE)
```

#### {n,m}

`{n, m}` is used when the item to its left is matched at least n times but not 
more than m times. In the below example, we are looking for package names that 
include the following pattern:

- includes the string `plot`
- `plot` is preceded by 1 or 3 `t`

```{r quantifier_match_between, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_quantifier_match_between_canva.png")
```

```{r quantifier_between_code}
grep(x = plot_pkgs, pattern = "(t){1,3}plot", value = TRUE)
```

## OR

```{r regex_or, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_or.png")
```

The `|` (OR) operator is useful when you want to match one amongst the given 
options. For example, let us say we are looking for package names that begin 
with `g` and is followed by either another `g` or `l`.

```{r or_round, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_or_round_bracket_canva.png")
```

```{r or_round_code}
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "g(g|l)", value = TRUE)
```

The square brackets (`[]`) can be used in place of `|` as shown in the below
example where we are looking for package names that begin with the letter 
`d` and is followed by either `e` or `p` or `a`.

```{r or_square, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_or_square_bracket_canva.png")
```

```{r or_square_code}
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "d[epa]", value = TRUE)
```
