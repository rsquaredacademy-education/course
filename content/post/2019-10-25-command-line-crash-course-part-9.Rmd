```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libs, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = TRUE)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
```

In this tutorial, you will be introduced to the command line. We have selected a set of commands we think will be useful in general to a wide range of audience.
We have created a [RStudio Cloud Project](https://rstudio.cloud/project/518720) to ensure that all readers are using the same environment while going through the tutorial. Our goal was to ensure that after completing this tutorial, readers should be able to use the shell for version control, managing cloud services (like deploying your own shiny server etc.), execute commands in R & RMarkdown and execute R scripts in the shell. Apart from learning shell commands, the tutorial will also focus on

- exploring R release names
- mapping shell commands to R functions
- RStudio Terminal
- executing shell commands from R using `system2()` or `processx::run()`
- execute shell commands in RMarkdown
- execute R scripts in the shell 

If you want a deeper understanding of using command line for data science, we suggest you read [Data Science at the Command Line](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/). [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) too has a lesson on [shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). We have listed more references at the end of the tutorial for the benefit of the readers.

## Execute Commands from R {#system2}

```{r cline_youtube_rinshell, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "r7N5HNtmKIc")
```

Now, let us turn our attention to executing commands from R using `system2()`. 
Here we will focus on the following

- execute a command without arguments
- execute commands with arguments
- redirect output

Let us try to execute a command without any additional arguments. We will execute the `ls` command to list all files and directories. Use `system2()` and specify the command using the `command` argument. Whenever you are trying to execute a command from R, the first argument or input should be the command and it must be enclosed in quotes.

```{r system2_1a, eval=FALSE}
system2(command = "ls")
```

```{r system2_1b, echo=FALSE}
system2(command = "ls", stdout = TRUE)
```

Great! Now, how do we specify the options? The additional options of a 
command must be stored as a character vector and specified using the `args`
argument. In the below example, we delete the `examples` folder we created earlier while decompressing the `zip_example.zip` file.

```{r system2_2a, eval=FALSE}
system2(command = "rm",
        args    = c("-r", "examples"))
```

```{r system2_2b, echo=FALSE}
system2(command = "rm",
        args    = c("-r", "examples"),
        stdout  = TRUE)
```

In some cases, we might want to redirect the output. Let us say we are writing 
message to a file using the `echo` command. In this cases, we want the output 
to be redirected to the `release.txt` file. The `stdout` argument can be used to redirect output to a file or the R console. In the below example, we redirect the output to a file.

```{r system2_3a}
system2(command = "echo", 
        args    = c("Great Truth"), 
        stdout  = "release.txt")
```

In the next example, we redirect the output to the R console by setting the value of the `stdout` argument to `TRUE`. If you are curious, set the value to `FALSE` and see what happens.

```{r system2_4a}
system2(command = "diff", 
        args    = c("imports_olsrr.txt", "imports_blorr.txt"),  
        stdout  = TRUE)
```

The `run()` command from the [processx](https://processx.r-lib.org/) package can be used to execute shell commands as well.

## Execute Shell Commands in RStudio {#shellrstudio}

In RStudio, commands can be executed from shell scripts by pressing `Ctrl + Enter`. Instead of sending the command to the R console, it is redirected to 
the terminal where it is executed as shown below.

```{r rstudio_shell, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/cline_rstudio_shell.gif")
```

## RMarkdown {#shellrmarkdown}

RMarkdown supports `bash`, `sh` and `awk`. This post was initially  created using `sh` as the underlying operating system is Windows. Later, we used `bash` after installing the Windows subsystem for Linux. Click [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#shell-scripts) to learn more.

```{r shell_rmarkdown, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/cline_shell_markdown.png")
```
