## Introduction

This is the fourth tutorial in the series [Handling Date & Time in R](https://tutorials.rsquaredacademy.com/date-time/index.html). In this tutorial, we will learn about timezones and daylight savings.

### Introduction

```{r img_timezones, fig.align='center', out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/img/lub_timezones.jpg')
```

In the previous section, `POSIXlt` stored date/time components as a list. Among 
the different components it returned were

- `gmtoff`
- `zone`

`gmtoff` is offset in seconds from GMT i.e. difference in hours and minutes from 
UTC. Wait.. What do UTC and GMT stand for?

- Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
- Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT)

Since we are talking about UTC, GMT etc., let us spend a little time on 
understanding the basics of time zones and daylight savings.

### Time Zones

Timezones exist because different parts of the Earth receive sun light at 
different times. If there was a single timezone, noon or morning would mean 
different things in different parts of the world. The timezones are based on 
Earth's rotation. The Earth moves ~15 degrees every 60 minutes i.e. 360 degrees 
in 24 hours. The planet is divided into 24 timezones, each 15 degrees of 
longitude width. 

Now, you have heard of Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT) right? We just saw GMT off 
set in `POSIXlt` and you would have come across it in other time formats as 
well. For example, India timezone is given as GMT +5:30. Let us explore GMT in a 
little more detail. Greenwich is a suburb of London and the time at Greenwich 
is **G**reenwich **M**ean **T**ime. As you move West from Greenwich, every 15 
degree section is one hour earlier than GMT and every 15 degree section to the 
East is an hour later. 

Alright! What is **UTC** then? **C**oordinated **U**niversal **T**ime (UTC) , 
on the other hand, is the time standard commonly used across the world. Even 
though they share the same current time, **GMT** is a **timezone** while 
**UTC** is a **time standard**.

So how do we check the timezone in R? When you run `Sys.timezone()`, you should 
be able to see the timezone you are in. 

```{r sys_time_zones}
Sys.timezone()
```

If you do not see the timezone, use `Sys.getenv()` to get the value of the 
**TZ** environment variable.

```{r get_time_zone}
Sys.getenv("TZ")
```

If nothing is returned, it means we have to set the timezone. Use `Sys.setenv()` 
to set the timezone as shown below. The author resides in India and hence the 
timezone is set to `Asia/Calcutta`. You need to set the timezone in which you 
reside or work.

```{r set_time_zone}
Sys.setenv(TZ = "Asia/Calcutta")
```

Another way to get the timezone is through `tz()` from the lubridate package.

```{r tz_release_date}
lubridate::tz(Sys.time())
```

If you want to view the time in a different timezone, use `with_tz()`. Let us 
look at the current time in **UTC** instead of **Indian Standard Time**.

```{r with_tz}
lubridate::with_tz(Sys.time(), "UTC")
```

### Daylight Savings

```{r img_daylight, fig.align='center', out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/img/lub_daylight_savings.png')
```

Daylight savings also known as 

- daylight saving time
- daylight savings time
- daylight time
- summer time

is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that darkness falls 
later each day according to the clock. In other words

- advance clock by one hour in spring (spring forward)
- retard clocks by one hour in autumn (fall back)

In R, the `dst()` function is an indicator for daylight savings. It returns 
`TRUE` if daylight saving is in force, `FALSE` if not and `NA` if unknown.

```{r dst}
Sys.Date()
dst(Sys.Date()) 
```

### Your Turn

- check the timezone you live in
- check if daylight savings in on
- check the current time in **UTC** or a different time zone
