```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libs, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = TRUE)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

This is the last tutorial in the series [Command Line Basics for R Users](https://tutorials.rsquaredacademy.com/command-line/index.html). In this tutorial, we will learn to execute R scripts in the command line.

## R in the Shell {#rinshell}

In this section, we will learn to execute R commands and scripts in the command line using:

- `R -e`
- `Rscript -e`
- `R CMD BATCH`

The `-e` option allows us to specify R expression(s). `R -e` will launch R and then execute the code specified within quotes. Use semi-colon to execute multiple expressions as shown below. You will be able to run the below commands only if you are able to launch R from the command line. Windows users need to ensure that R is added to the path environment.

```{sh c118a, eval=FALSE}
R -e "head(mtcars); tail(mtcars)"
```

`Rscript -e` will run code without launching R.

```{sh c119a, eval=FALSE}
Rscript -e "head(mtcars)"
```

We can use `Rscript` to execute a R script as well. In the below example, we execute the code in `analysis.R` file. 

```{sh c120a, eval=FALSE}
Rscript analysis.R
```
