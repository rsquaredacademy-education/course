```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libs, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = TRUE)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
```

```{r cover_image, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/cline_cover_image.png")
```

In this tutorial, you will be introduced to the command line. We have selected a set of commands we think will be useful in general to a wide range of audience.
We have created a [RStudio Cloud Project](https://rstudio.cloud/project/518720) to ensure that all readers are using the same environment while going through the tutorial. Our goal was to ensure that after completing this tutorial, readers should be able to use the shell for version control, managing cloud services (like deploying your own shiny server etc.), execute commands in R & RMarkdown and execute R scripts in the shell. Apart from learning shell commands, the tutorial will also focus on

- exploring R release names
- mapping shell commands to R functions
- RStudio Terminal
- executing shell commands from R using `system2()` or `processx::run()`
- execute shell commands in RMarkdown
- execute R scripts in the shell 

If you want a deeper understanding of using command line for data science, we suggest you read [Data Science at the Command Line](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/). [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) too has a lesson on [shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). We have listed more references at the end of the tutorial for the benefit of the readers.

## Navigating File System {#navigate}

```{r cline_youtube_navigate, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "yn0sVrEM8AA")
```

In this section, we will learn commands that will help us

- navigate between different folders/directories 
- return current working directory 
- list all the files & folders in a directory 
- create and delete directories

```{r table_nav_file_sys, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`pwd`", "`ls`", "`cd`", "`mkdir`", "`rmdir`")
descrip <- c("Print working directory",
             "List directory contents",
             "Change current working directory", 
             "Create directory",
             "Remove/delete directory")
data.frame(Command = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

`pwd` displays the name of the **p**resent **w**orking **d**irectory. 

```{bash c3a, eval=FALSE}
pwd
```

```{bash c3b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
pwd
```

`ls` displays information about files and directories in the current directory along with their associated metadata such as 

- size
- ownership
- modification date 

With no options, it will list the files and directories in the current directory, sorted alphabetically.

```{bash c4a, eval=FALSE}
ls
```

```{bash c4b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
ls
```

`cd` (**c**hange **d**irectory) changes the current working directory. It is among the most used commands as it allows the user to move around the file system.

```{bash c6a, eval=FALSE}
cd r
pwd
```

```{bash c6b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
cd r
pwd
```

`mkdir` will create new directory. It will allow you to set file mode (permissions associated with the directory) i.e. who can open/modify/delete the directory.

```{bash c5a, eval=FALSE}
mkdir rfiles
ls
```

```{bash c5b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
mkdir rfiles
ls
```

`rmdir` will remove empty directories from the file system. It can be used to remove multiple empty directories as well. If the directory is not empty, `rmdir` will not remove it and instead display a warning that the directory is not empty.

```{bash c10a, eval=FALSE}
rmdir rfiles
ls
```

```{bash c10b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
rmdir rfiles
ls
```

### Change Working Directory

Let us focus a bit more on changing working directory. The below table shows commands for changing working directory to

- up one level
- previous working directory
- home directory
- and root directory

```{r table_cd, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`cd .`", "`cd ..`", "`cd -`", "`cd ~`", "`cd /`")
descrip <- c("Navigate into directory",
             "Go up one level",
             "Go to previous working directory", 
             "Change directory to home directory",
             "Change directory to root directory")
data.frame(Command = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

All files and directories stem from one main directory, the root directory. All the other directories in the system are sub-directories of the root directory and the root directory has no parent directory. It is represented by a single slash (`/`). `cd /` will change the current working directory to the root directory. In RStudio Cloud, use `cd` and `cd ..` to navigate back to the current working directory. If you get confused, close the terminal and relaunch it.

```{bash c8a, eval=FALSE}
cd /
pwd
```

```{bash c8b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
cd /
pwd
```

The parent directory i.e. the directory one level up from the current directory which contains the directory we are in now is represented by two dots (`..`). `cd ..` will change us into the parent directory of the current directory.

```{bash c7a, eval=FALSE}
cd ..
pwd
```

```{bash c7b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
cd ..
pwd
```

The home directory is the directory we are placed in, by default, when we launch a new terminal session. It is represented by the tilde (`~`). In RStudio Cloud, use `cd` and `cd ..` to navigate back to the current working directory. If you get confused, close the terminal and relaunch it.

```{bash c74a, eval=FALSE}
cd ~
pwd
```

```{bash c74b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
cd ~
pwd
```

To change into the previous working directory, use `cd -`.

```{bash c75a, eval=FALSE}
cd -
pwd
```

```{bash c75b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
cd -
pwd
```

The current working directory is represented by a single dot (`.`). `cd .` will change us into the current directory i.e. it will do nothing. 

### List Directory Contents

`ls` will list the contents of a directory. Using different arguments, we can

- list hidden files
- view file permissions, ownership, size & modification date
- sort by size & modification date

```{r table_ls, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`ls`", "`ls -l`", "`ls -a`", "`ls -la`", "`ls -lh`", "`ls -lS`", "`ls -ltr`")
descrip <- c("List directory contents",
             "List files one per line",
             "List all files including hidden files", 
             "Display file permissions, ownership, size & modification date",
             "Long format list with size displayed in human readable format",
             "Long format list sorted by size",
             "Long format list sorted by modification date")
data.frame(Command = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

#### List files one per line

```{bash c11a, eval=FALSE}
ls -l
```

```{bash c11b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
ls -l
```

#### List all files including hidden files

```{bash c12a, eval=FALSE}
ls -a
```

```{bash c12b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
ls -a
```

#### Display file permissions, ownership, size & modification date

```{bash c13a, eval=FALSE}
ls -la
```

```{bash c13b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
ls -la
```

#### Display size in human readable format

```{bash c14a, eval=FALSE}
ls -lh
```

```{bash c14b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
ls -lh
```

#### Sort list by size

```{bash c15a, eval=FALSE}
ls -lS
```

```{bash c15b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
ls -lS
```

#### Sort list by modification date

```{bash c16a, eval=FALSE}
ls -ltr
```

```{bash c16b, echo=FALSE}
cd cline
ls -ltr
```

### R Functions

In R, `getwd()` will return the current working directory. You can use `here()` from the [here](https://here.r-lib.org/) package as well. To change the current
working directory, use `setwd()`. The [fs](https://fs.r-lib.org/index.html) package provides useful functions for file operations. 

```{r r_nav_file_sys, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`pwd`", "`ls`", "`cd`", "`mkdir`", "`rmdir`")
r_map   <- c("`getwd()` / `here::here()`",
             "`dir()` / `list.files()` / `list.dirs()` / `fs::dir_ls()` / `dir_info()`",
             "`setwd()`",
             "`dir.create()` / `fs::dir_create()`",
             "`fs::dir_delete()`")
data.frame(Command = cname, R  = r_map) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```
