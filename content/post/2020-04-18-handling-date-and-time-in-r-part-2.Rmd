## Date & Time Classes {#classes}

```{r cline_youtube_classes, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "IEX49t8sSgw")
```

In this section, we will look at two things. First, how to create date/time
data in R, and second, how to convert other data types to date/time. Let us 
begin by creating the release date of R 3.6.2.

```{r date_manual}
release_date <- 2019-12-12
release_date
```

Okay! Why do we see `1995` when we call the date? What is happening here? Let us 
quickly check the data type of `release_date`.

```{r date_type}
class(release_date)
```

The data type is `numeric` i.e. R has subtracted `12` twice from `2019` to 
return `1995`. Clearly, the above method is not the right way to store 
date/time. Let us see if we can get some hints from the built-in R functions we 
used in the previous section. If you observe the output, all of them returned 
date/time wrapped in quotes. Hmmm... let us wrap our date in quotes and see what 
happens.

```{r date_wrap}
release_date <- "2019-12-12"
release_date
```

Alright, now R does not do any arithmetic and returns the date as we specified. 
Great! Is this the right format to store date/time then? No. Why? What is the problem 
if date/time is saved as character/string? The problem is the nature or type of 
operations done on date/time are different when compared to string/character, 
number or logical values.

- how do we add/subtract dates?
- how do we extract components such as year, month, day etc.

To answer the above questions, we will first check the data type of `Sys.Date()` 
and `now()`.

```{r check_date_type}
class(Sys.Date())
class(lubridate::now())
class(release_date)
```

As you can see from the above output, there are 3 different classes for storing
date/time in R 

- `Date`
- `POSIXct`
- `POSIXlt`

Let us explore each of the above classes one by one.

### Date

#### Introduction

The `Date` class represents calendar dates. Let us go back to `Sys.Date()`. If 
you check the class of `Sys.Date()`, it is `Date`. Internally, this date is a 
number i.e. an integer. The `unclass()` function will show how dates are stored 
internally.

```{r unclass_sys_date}
Sys.Date()
unclass(Sys.Date())
```

What does this integer represent? Why has R stored the date as an integer? 
In R, dates are represented as the number of days since `1970-01-01`. All the dates in R are 
internally stored in this way. Before we explore this concept further, let us 
learn to create `Date` objects in R. We will continue to use the release date
of R 3.6.2, `2019-12-12`.

Until now, we have stored the above date as character/string but now we will use 
`as.Date()` to save it as a `Date` object. `as.Date()` is the easiest and 
simplest way to create dates in R.

```{r release_as_date}
release_date <- as.Date("2019-12-12")
release_date
```

The `as_date()` function from the lubridate package is similar to `as.Date()`.

```{r release_date_lubridate}
release_date <- lubridate::as_date("2019-12-12")
release_date
```

If you look at the difference between `release_date` and `1970-01-01`, it will 
be the same as `unclass(release_date)`.

```{r release_date_unclass}
release_date - as.Date("1970-01-01")
unclass(release_date)
```

Let us come back to `1970-01-01` i.e. the origin for dates in R. 

```{r origin}
lubridate::origin
```

From the previous examples, we know that dates are internally stored as number
of days since `1970-01-01`. How about dates older than the origin? How are they
stored? Let us look at that briefly.

```{r older_than_origin}
unclass(as.Date("1963-08-28"))
```

Dates older than the origin are stored as negative integers. For those who are 
not aware, Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famous **I Have a Dream** 
speech on `1963-08-28`. Let us move on and learn how to convert numbers into 
dates.

#### Convert Numeric

The `as.Date()` function can be used to convert any of the following to a `Date` 
object

- character/string
- number
- factor (categorical/qualitative)

We have explored how to convert strings to date. How about converting numbers to 
date? Sure, we can create date from numbers by specifying the origin and number 
of days since it. 

```{r release_date_origin}
as.Date(18242, origin = "1970-01-01")
```

The origin can be changed to another date (while changing the number as well.)

```{r release_date_diff_origin}
as.Date(7285, origin = "2000-01-01")
```

### ISO 8601 

```{r img1lub, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics('/img/iso.png')
```

If you have carefully observed, the format in which we have been specifying the 
dates as well as of those returned by functions such as `Sys.Date()` or 
`Sys.time()` is the same i.e. `YYYY-MM-DD`. It includes

- the year including the century
- the month
- the date

The month and date separated by `-`. This default format used in R is the ISO 
8601 standard for date/time. ISO 8601 is the internationally accepted way to 
represent dates and times and uses the 24 hour clock system. Let us create the 
release date using another function `ISOdate()`.

```{r iso_date}
ISOdate(year  = 2019,
        month = 12,
        day   = 12,
        hour  = 8,
        min   = 5, 
        sec   = 3,
        tz    = "UTC")
```

We will look at all the different weird ways in which date/time are specified in 
the real world in the [Date & Time Formats] section. For the time being, let us 
continue exploring date/time classes in R. The next class we are going to look 
at is `POSIXct/POSIXlt`.

### POSIX

You might be wondering what is this POSIX thing? POSIX stands for **P**ortable 
**O**perating **S**ystem **I**nterface. It is a family of standards specified for 
maintaining compatibility between different operating systems. Before we 
learn to create POSIX objects, let us look at `now()` from lubridate.

```{r now_class}
class(lubridate::now())
```

`now()` returns current date/time as a POSIXct object. Let us look at its
internal representation using `unclass()`

```{r now_unclass}
unclass(lubridate::now())
```

The output you see is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.

#### POSIXct

`POSIXct` represents the number of seconds since the beginning of 1970 (UTC) and 
`ct` stands for calendar time.  To store date/time as `POSIXct` objects, use 
`as.POSIXct()`. Let us now store the release date of R 3.6.2 as `POSIXct` as shown 
below

```{r release_date_posixct}
release_date <- as.POSIXct("2019-12-12 08:05:03")
class(release_date)
unclass(release_date) 
```

#### POSIXlt

`POSIXlt` represents the following information in a list

- seconds
- minutes
- hour
- day of the month
- month
- year
- day of week
- day of year
- daylight saving time flag
- time zone
- offset in seconds from GMT

The `lt` in `POSIXlt` stands for local time. Use `as.POSIXlt()` to store 
date/time as `POSIXlt` objects. Let us store the release date as a `POSIXlt` 
object as shown below

```{r release_date_posixlt_1}
release_date <- as.POSIXlt("2019-12-12 08:05:03")
release_date
```

As we said earlier, `POSIXlt` stores date/time components in a list and these 
can be extracted. Let us look at the date/time components returned by `POSIXlt` 
using `unclass()`.

```{r release_date_posixlt_2}
release_date <- as.POSIXlt("2019-12-12 08:05:03")
unclass(release_date)
```

Use `unlist()` if you want the components returned as a `vector`.

```{r release_date_posixlt_3}
release_date <- as.POSIXlt("2019-12-12 08:05:03")
unlist(release_date)
```

To extract specific components, use `$`. 

```{r release_date_posixlt_4}
release_date <- as.POSIXlt("2019-12-12 08:05:03")
release_date$hour
release_date$mon
release_date$zone
```

Now, let us look at the components returned by `POSIXlt`. Some of them are 
intuitive

```{r table_posixlt_1, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`sec`", "`min`", "`hour`", "`mon`", "`zone`", "`wday`", "`mday`", "`year`", "`yday`", "`isdst`", "`gmtoff`")
descrip <- c("Second", "Minute", "Hour of the day", "Month of the year (0-11",
             "Timezone", "Day of week", "Day of month","Years since 1900", 
             "Day of year", "Daylight saving flag", 
             "Offset is seconds from GMT")
data.frame(Component = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

Great! We will end this section with a few tips/suggestions on when to use 
`Date` or `POSIXct/POSIXlt`. 

- use `Date` when there is no time component
- use `POSIX` when dealing with time and timezones
- use `POSIXlt` when you want to access/extract the different components

### Your Turn

R 1.0.0 was released on `2000-02-29 08:55:23 UTC`. Save it as 

- `Date` using character 
- `Date` using origin and number
- `POSIXct`
- `POSIXlt` and extract 
    - month day
    - day of year
    - month
    - zone
- ISODate
