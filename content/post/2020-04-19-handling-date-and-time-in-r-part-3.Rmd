```{r show, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
transact <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/transact.csv')
```

## Date Arithmetic {#arithmetic}

```{r cline_youtube_arithmetic, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "iNzv8Ezpjw0")
```

Time to do some arithmetic with the dates. Let us calculate the length of a 
course you have enrolled for (Become a Rock Star Data Scientist in 10 Days) by subtracting the course start date from the course end date.

<br>

```{r img2lub, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/course_duration.png")
```

<br>

```{r lub19, collapse = TRUE}
course_start    <- as_date('2017-04-12')
course_end      <- as_date('2017-04-21')
course_duration <- course_end - course_start
course_duration
```

### Shift Date

Time to shift the course dates. We can shift a date by days, weeks or months. Let us shift the course start date by:

- 2 days
- 3 weeks
- 1 year

<br>

```{r img3lub, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/shift_dates.png")
```

<br>

```{r lab40, collapse = TRUE}
course_start + days(2)
course_start + weeks(3)
course_start + years(1)
```

### Case Study

#### Compute days to settle invoice

Let us estimate the number of days to settle the invoice by subtracting the
date of invoice from the date of payment.

```{r lub3}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    days_to_pay = Payment - Invoice
  )
```

#### Compute days over due

How many of the invoices were settled post the due date? We can find this by:

- subtracting the due date from the payment date
- counting the number of rows where delay > 0 

```{r lub4}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    delay = Payment - Due
  ) %>%
  filter(delay > 0) %>% 
  count(delay)
```

### Your Turn

- compute the length of a vacation which begins on `2020-04-19` and ends on `2020-04-25`
- recompute the length of the vacation after shifting the vacation start and end date by `10` days and `2` weeks
- compute the days to settle invoice and days overdue from the `receivables.csv` data set
- compute the length of employment (only for those employees who have been terminated) from the `hr-data.csv` data set (use date of hire and termination)
