## Introduction

This is the fourth tutorial in the series [Demystifying Regular Expressions in R](https://tutorials.rsquaredacademy.com/regex/index.html). In this tutorial, we will learn about metacharacters.

## Meta Characters

Meta characters are a special set of characters not captured by regular 
expressions i.e. if these special characters are present in a string, regular
expressions will not detect them. In order to be detected, they must be 
prefixed by double backslash (\\). The below table displays the metacharacters:

```{r meta_characters, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_meta_characters.png")
```

Now that we know the meta characters, let us look at some examples. In the first
example, we want to detect package names separated by a dot.

```{r read_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_csv("package_names.csv") %>%
  pull(1) -> r_packages 
```


```{r meta_1}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = ".", value = TRUE)[1:60]
```

If you look at the output, it includes names of even those package names which
are not separated by dot. Why is this happening? A dot is special character in 
regular expressions. It is also known as wildcard character i.e. it is used to 
match any character other than `\n` (new line). Now let us try to escape it 
using the double backslash (`\\`).

```{r meta_2}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\.", value = TRUE)[1:50]
```

When we use `\\.`, it matches the dot. Feel free to play around with other
special characters mentioned in the table but ensure that you use a different
data set.

## Up Next..

In the next tutorial, we will explore quantifiers.
