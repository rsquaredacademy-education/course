## Introduction

In this post, we will learn about using regular expressions in R. While it is 
aimed at absolute beginners, we hope experienced users will find it useful as 
well. The post is broadly divided into 3 sections. In the first section, we 
will introduce the pattern matching functions such as `grep`, `grepl` etc. in 
base R as we will be using them in the rest of the post. Once the reader is 
comfortable with the above mentioned pattern matching functions, we will 
learn about regular expressions while exploring the names of R packages by 
probing the following:

- how many package names include the letter `r`?
- how many package names begin or end with the letter `r`?
- how many package names include the words `data` or `plot`?

In the final section, we will go through 4 case studies including simple email
validation. If you plan to try the case studies, please do not skip any of the
topics in the second section. 

## Sequences

```{r regex_sequences, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_sequences.png")
```

#### Digit Character

`\\d` matches any digit character. Let us use it to find package names that 
include a digit.

```{r sequence_digit, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_match_digit.png")
```

```{r top_downloads, echo=FALSE}
top_downloads <- c("devtools", "rlang", "dplyr", "Rcpp", "tibble",    
                   "ggplot2", "glue", "pillar", "cli", "data.table")

top_downloads
```

```{r read_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_csv("package_names.csv") %>%
  pull(1) -> r_packages 
```

```{r digit_code}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\d", value = TRUE)[1:50]

# invert
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\d", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)[1:50]
```

In the next few examples, we will not use R package names data, instead we will 
use dummy data of Invoice IDs and see if they conform to certain rules such as:

- they should include letters and numbers
- they should not include symbols
- they should not include space or tab

#### Non Digit Character

`\\D` matches any non-digit character. Let us use it to remove invoice ids that
include only numbers and no letters.

```{r sequence_non_digit, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_match_non_digit.png")
```

As you can see below, thre are 3 invoice ids that did not conform to the rules 
and have been removed. Only those invoice ids that have both letter and numbers
have been returned.

```{r non_digit_code}
invoice_id <- c("R536365", "R536472", "R536671", "536915", "R536125", "R536287",
                "536741", "R536893", "R536521", "536999")
grep(x = invoice_id, pattern = "\\D", value = TRUE)

# invert
grep(x = invoice_id, pattern = "\\D", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

#### White Space Character

`\\s` matches any white space character such as space or tab. Let us use it to
detect invoice ids that include any white space (space or tab).

```{r sequence_space, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_match_space.png")
```

As you can see below, there are 4 invoice ids that include white space 
character.

```{r space_code}
grep(x = c("R536365", "R 536472", "R536671", "R536915", "R53 6125", "R536287",
           "536741", "R5368  93", "R536521", "536 999"), 
     pattern = "\\s", value = TRUE)

grep(x = c("R536365", "R 536472", "R536671", "R536915", "R53 6125", "R536287",
           "536741", "R5368  93", "R536521", "536 999"), 
     pattern = "\\s", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

#### Non White Space Character

`\\S` matches any non white space character. Let us use it to remove any 
invoice ids which are blank or missing.

```{r sequence_non_space, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_match_non_space.png")
```

As you can see below, two invoice ids which were blank have been removed. If you
observe carefully, it does not remove any invoice ids which have a white space
character present, it only removes those which are completely blank i.e. those
which include only space or tab.

```{r non_space_code}
grep(x = c("R536365", "R 536472", " ", "R536915", "R53 6125", "R536287",
           " ", "R5368  93", "R536521", "536 999"), 
     pattern = "\\S", value = TRUE)

# invert
grep(x = c("R536365", "R 536472", " ", "R536915", "R53 6125", "R536287",
           " ", "R5368  93", "R536521", "536 999"), 
     pattern = "\\S", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

#### Word Character

`\\w` matches any word character i.e. alphanumeric. It includes the following:

- a to z
- A to Z
- 0 to 9
- underscore(_)

```{r sequence_word, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_match_word.png")
```

Let us use it to remove those invoice ids which include only symbols or special
characters. Again, you can see that it does not remove those ids which include
both word characters and symbols as it will match any string that includes 
word characters.

```{r word_code}
grep(x = c("R536365", "%+$!#@?", "R536671", "R536915", "$%+#!@?", "R5362@87",
           "53+67$41", "R536893", "@$+%#!", "536#999"), 
     pattern = "\\w", value = TRUE)

# invert
grep(x = c("R536365", "%+$!#@?", "R536671", "R536915", "$%+#!@?", "R5362@87",
           "53+67$41", "R536893", "@$+%#!", "536#999"), 
     pattern = "\\w", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

#### Non Word Character

`\\W` matches any non-word character i.e. symbols. It includes everything that
is not a word character.

```{r sequence_non_word, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_match_non_word.png")
```

Let us use it to detect invoice ids that include any non-word character. As you
can see only 4 ids do not include non-word characters.

```{r non_word_code}
grep(x = c("R536365", "%+$!#@?", "R536671", "R536915", "$%+#!@?", "R5362@87",
           "53+67$41", "R536893", "@$+%#!", "536#999"), 
     pattern = "\\W", value = TRUE)

# invert
grep(x = c("R536365", "%+$!#@?", "R536671", "R536915", "$%+#!@?", "R5362@87",
           "53+67$41", "R536893", "@$+%#!", "536#999"), 
     pattern = "\\W", value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)
```

## Word Boundary

`\\b` and `\\B` are similar to caret and dollar symbol. They match at a position
called word boundary. Now, what is a word boundary? The following 3 positions
qualify as word boundaries:

- before the first character in the string
- after the last character in the string
- between two characters in the string

In the first 2 cases, the character must be a word character whereas in the 
last case, one should be a word character and another non-word character. Sounds
confusing? It will be clear once we go through a few examples.

Let us say we are looking for package names beginning with the string `stat`. 
In this case, we can prefix `stat` with `\\b`. 

```{r word_boundary_1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_word_boundary_1.png")
```

```{r boundary_code_2}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\bstat", value = TRUE) 
```

Suffix `\\b` to `stat` to look at all package names that end with the string 
`stat`.

```{r word_boundary_2, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_word_boundary_2.png")
```

If you observe the output, you can find package names that do not end with 
the string `stat`. `spatstat.data`, `spatstat.local` and `spatstat.utils` do not
end with `stat` but satisfy the third condition mentioned aboved for word 
boundaries. They are between 2 characters where `t` is a word character and dot
is a non-word character.

```{r boundary_code_3}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "stat\\b", value = TRUE)
```

Do package names include the string `stat` either at the end or in the middle 
but not at the beginning? Prefix `stat` with `\\B` to find the answer.

```{r word_boundary_3, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_word_boundary_3.png")
```

```{r boundary_code_4}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\Bstat", value = TRUE)
```

Are there packages whose names include the string `stat` either at the 
beginning or in the middle but not at the end. Suffix `\\B` to `stat` to 
answer this question.

```{r word_boundary_4, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_word_boundary_4.png")
```

```{r boundary_code_5}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "stat\\B", value = TRUE)
```

Prefix and suffix `\\B` to `stat` to look at package names that include the 
string `stat` but neither in the beginning nor in the end. 

```{r word_boundary_5, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_word_boundary_5.png")
```

In the below output, you can observe that the string `stat` must be between
two word characters. Those examples we showed in the case of `\\b` where it 
was surrounded by a dot do not hold here.

```{r boundary_code_6}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\Bstat\\B", value = TRUE)
```
