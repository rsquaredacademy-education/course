```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r regex_cover_image, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}

```

## Introduction

This is the first tutorial in the series [Demystifying Regular Expressions in R](https://tutorials.rsquaredacademy.com/regex/index.html).
In this series, we will learn about using regular expressions in R. While it is 
aimed at absolute beginners, we hope experienced users will find it useful as 
well. The series is broadly divided into 3 sections. In the first section, we 
will introduce the pattern matching functions such as `grep`, `grepl` etc. in 
base R as we will be using them in the rest of the tutorial. Once the reader is 
comfortable with the above mentioned pattern matching functions, we will 
learn about regular expressions while exploring the names of R packages by 
probing the following:

- how many package names include the letter `r`?
- how many package names begin or end with the letter `r`?
- how many package names include the words `data` or `plot`?

In the final section, we will go through 4 case studies including simple email
validation. If you plan to try the case studies, please do not skip any of the
topics in the second section. 

### What

```{r regex_what, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_what.png")
```

### Why

Regular expressions can be used for:

- search
- replace
- validation
- extraction

```{r regex_why, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_why.png")
```

### Use Cases

Regular expressions have applications in a wide range of areas. We list some of 
the most popular ones below:

- email validation
- password validation
- date validation
- phone number validation
- search and replace in text editors
- web scraping

```{r regex_use_case, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_use_case_blog.png")
```

## Learning

The below steps offer advice on the best way to learn or use regular expressions:

- describe the pattern in layman terms
- break down the pattern into individual components  
- match each component to a regular expression
- build incrementally
- test 

## Resources

## Libraries

We will use the following libraries in this tutorial:

```{r install, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

## Data

We will use two data sets in this tutorial. The first one is a list of all R 
packages on CRAN and is present in the `package_names.csv` file, and the
second one, `top_downloads`, is the most downloaded packages from the 
<a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">RStudio CRAN mirror</a> 
in the first week of May 2019, and extracted using the 
<a href="https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/#rpackage" target="_blank">cranlogs</a> pacakge. 

### R Packages Data

```{r read_data, message=FALSE}
read_csv("package_names.csv") %>%
  pull(1) -> r_packages 
```

### Top R Packages

```{r top_downloads}
top_downloads <- c("devtools", "rlang", "dplyr", "Rcpp", "tibble",    
                   "ggplot2", "glue", "pillar", "cli", "data.table")

top_downloads
```

## Up Next..

In the next tutorial, we will explore pattern matching.
