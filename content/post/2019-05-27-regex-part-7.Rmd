## Introduction

In this post, we will learn about using regular expressions in R. While it is 
aimed at absolute beginners, we hope experienced users will find it useful as 
well. The post is broadly divided into 3 sections. In the first section, we 
will introduce the pattern matching functions such as `grep`, `grepl` etc. in 
base R as we will be using them in the rest of the post. Once the reader is 
comfortable with the above mentioned pattern matching functions, we will 
learn about regular expressions while exploring the names of R packages by 
probing the following:

- how many package names include the letter `r`?
- how many package names begin or end with the letter `r`?
- how many package names include the words `data` or `plot`?

In the final section, we will go through 4 case studies including simple email
validation. If you plan to try the case studies, please do not skip any of the
topics in the second section. 

## Character Classes

```{r regex_character_classes, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_character_classes.png")
```

A set of characters enclosed in a square bracket (`[]`). The regular expression
will match only those characters enclosed in the brackets and it matches only a
single character. The order of the characters inside the brackets do not matter 
and a hyphen can be used to specify a range of charcters. For example, [0-9] 
will match a single digit between 0 and 9. Similarly, [a-z] will match a single 
letter between a to z. You can specify more than one range as well. [a-z0-9A-Z]
will match a alphanumeric character while ignoring the case. A caret **^** after
the opening bracket negates the character class. For example, [^0-9] will match
a single character that is not a digit.

```{r character_class_numbers, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_character_class_numbers.png")
```
Let us go through a few examples to understand character classes in more detail.

```{r character_code_1}
# package names that include vowels
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "[aeiou]", value = TRUE)

# package names that include a number
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "[0-9]", value = TRUE)[1:50]

# package names that begin with a number
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "^[0-9]", value = TRUE)

# package names that end with a number
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "[0-9]$", value = TRUE)[1:50]

# package names with only upper case letters
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "^[A-Z][A-Z]{1, }[A-Z]$", value = TRUE)[1:50]
```
