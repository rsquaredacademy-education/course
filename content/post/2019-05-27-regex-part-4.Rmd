## Introduction

In this post, we will learn about using regular expressions in R. While it is 
aimed at absolute beginners, we hope experienced users will find it useful as 
well. The post is broadly divided into 3 sections. In the first section, we 
will introduce the pattern matching functions such as `grep`, `grepl` etc. in 
base R as we will be using them in the rest of the post. Once the reader is 
comfortable with the above mentioned pattern matching functions, we will 
learn about regular expressions while exploring the names of R packages by 
probing the following:

- how many package names include the letter `r`?
- how many package names begin or end with the letter `r`?
- how many package names include the words `data` or `plot`?

In the final section, we will go through 4 case studies including simple email
validation. If you plan to try the case studies, please do not skip any of the
topics in the second section. 

## Meta Characters

Meta characters are a special set of characters not captured by regular 
expressions i.e. if these special characters are present in a string, regular
expressions will not detect them. In order to be detected, they must be 
prefixed by double backslash (\\). The below table displays the metacharacters:

```{r meta_characters, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_meta_characters.png")
```

Now that we know the meta characters, let us look at some examples. In the first
example, we want to detect package names separated by a dot.

```{r read_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_csv("package_names.csv") %>%
  pull(1) -> r_packages 
```


```{r meta_1}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = ".", value = TRUE)[1:60]
```

If you look at the output, it includes names of even those package names which
are not separated by dot. Why is this happening? A dot is special character in 
regular expressions. It is also known as wildcard character i.e. it is used to 
match any character other than `\n` (new line). Now let us try to escape it 
using the double backslash (`\\`).

```{r meta_2}
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "\\.", value = TRUE)[1:50]
```

When we use `\\.`, it matches the dot. Feel free to play around with other
special characters mentioned in the table but ensure that you use a different
data set.
