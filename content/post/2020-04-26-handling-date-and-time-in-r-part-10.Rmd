## Round & Rollback  {#others}

```{r cline_youtube_others, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "ZI1s6XQgCbo")
```

In this section, we will learn to round date/time to the nearest unit and roll 
back dates. 

### Rounding Dates

We will explore functions for rounding dates

- to the nearest value using `round_dates()`
- down using `floor_date()`
- up using `ceiling_date()`

The unit for rounding can be any of the following:

- second
- minute
- hour
- day
- week
- month
- bimonth
- quarter
- season
- halfyear
- and year

We will look at a few examples using `round_date()` and you will then practice 
using the other two functions.

```{r round_release_date, echo=FALSE}
release_date <- ymd_hms("2019-12-12 08:05:03")
```

```{r round_dates}
# minute
round_date(release_date, unit = "minute")
round_date(release_date, unit = "mins")
round_date(release_date, unit = "5 mins")

# hour
round_date(release_date, unit = "hour")

# day
round_date(release_date, unit = "day")
```

### Rollback 

Use `rollback()` if you want to change the date to the last day of the previous 
month or the first day of the month.

```{r rollback_1}
rollback(release_date)
```

To change the date to the first day of the month, use the `roll_to_first` 
argument and set it to `TRUE`.

```{r rollback_2}
rollback(release_date, roll_to_first = TRUE)
```

### Your Turn

- round up R release dates to hours
- round down R release dates to minutes
- rollback R release dates to the beginning of the month
