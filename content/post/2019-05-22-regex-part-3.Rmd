## Introduction

This is the third tutorial in the series [Demystifying Regular Expressions in R](https://tutorials.rsquaredacademy.com/regex/index.html). In this tutorial, we will learn about anchors.

## Regular Expressions

So far we have been exploring R functions for pattern matching with a very 
simple pattern i.e. a single character. From this section, we will start
exploring different scenarios and the corresponding regular expressions. This 
section is further divided into 5 sub sections:

- anchors
- metacharacters
- quantifiers
- sequences 
- and character classes

## Anchors 

Anchors do not match any character. Instead, they match the pattern supplied to
a position before, after or between characters i.e. they are used to anchor the 
regex or pattern at a certain position. Anchors are useful when we are searching 
for a pattern at the beggining or end of a string.

```{r regex_anchors, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_anchors.png")
```

### Caret Symbol (^)

The caret **^** matches the position before the first character in the string.
In the below example, we want to know the R packages whose names begin with
the letter `r`. To achieve this, we use `^`, the caret symbol, which specifies 
that the pattern must be present at the beginning of the string.

```{r anchor_start}, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_anchor_start_canva.png")
```

```{r top_downloads, echo=FALSE}
top_downloads <- c("devtools", "rlang", "dplyr", "Rcpp", "tibble",    
                   "ggplot2", "glue", "pillar", "cli", "data.table")

top_downloads
```

```{r anchor_start_code}
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "^r", value = TRUE)
```

It has returned only one package, `rlang` but if you look at the package names
even `Rcpp` begins with `r` but has been ignored. Let us ignore the case of the
pattern and see if the results change.

```{r anchor_start_ignore_case, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_anchor_start_ignore_case_canva.png")
```

```{r anchor_start_ignore_case_code}
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "^r", value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

### Dollar Symbol ($)

The dollar $ matches right after the last character in the string. Let us 
now look at packages whose names end with the letter `r`. To achieve this, we 
use `$`, the dollar symbol. As you can see in the below example, the `$` is 
specified at the end of the pattern we are looking for.

```{r anchor_end, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_anchor_end_canva.png")
```

From our sample data set, we can see that there are 2 packages that end with
the letter `r`, dplyr and pillar.

```{r anchor_end_code}
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "r$", value = TRUE)
```

## Up Next..

In the next tutorial, we will explore metacharacters.
