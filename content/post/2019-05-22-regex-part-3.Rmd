## Introduction

In this post, we will learn about using regular expressions in R. While it is 
aimed at absolute beginners, we hope experienced users will find it useful as 
well. The post is broadly divided into 3 sections. In the first section, we 
will introduce the pattern matching functions such as `grep`, `grepl` etc. in 
base R as we will be using them in the rest of the post. Once the reader is 
comfortable with the above mentioned pattern matching functions, we will 
learn about regular expressions while exploring the names of R packages by 
probing the following:

- how many package names include the letter `r`?
- how many package names begin or end with the letter `r`?
- how many package names include the words `data` or `plot`?

In the final section, we will go through 4 case studies including simple email
validation. If you plan to try the case studies, please do not skip any of the
topics in the second section. 

## Regular Expressions

So far we have been exploring R functions for pattern matching with a very 
simple pattern i.e. a single character. From this section, we will start
exploring different scenarios and the corresponding regular expressions. This 
section is further divided into 5 sub sections:

- anchors
- metacharacters
- quantifiers
- sequences 
- and character classes

## Anchors 

Anchors do not match any character. Instead, they match the pattern supplied to
a position before, after or between characters i.e. they are used to anchor the 
regex or pattern at a certain position. Anchors are useful when we are searching 
for a pattern at the beggining or end of a string.

```{r regex_anchors, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_anchors.png")
```

### Caret Symbol (^)

The caret **^** matches the position before the first character in the string.
In the below example, we want to know the R packages whose names begin with
the letter `r`. To achieve this, we use `^`, the caret symbol, which specifies 
that the pattern must be present at the beginning of the string.

```{r anchor_start}, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_anchor_start_canva.png")
```

```{r top_downloads, echo=FALSE}
top_downloads <- c("devtools", "rlang", "dplyr", "Rcpp", "tibble",    
                   "ggplot2", "glue", "pillar", "cli", "data.table")

top_downloads
```

```{r anchor_start_code}
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "^r", value = TRUE)
```

It has returned only one package, `rlang` but if you look at the package names
even `Rcpp` begins with `r` but has been ignored. Let us ignore the case of the
pattern and see if the results change.

```{r anchor_start_ignore_case, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_anchor_start_ignore_case_canva.png")
```

```{r anchor_start_ignore_case_code}
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "^r", value = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
```

### Dollar Symbol ($)

The dollar $ matches right after the last character in the string. Let us 
now look at packages whose names end with the letter `r`. To achieve this, we 
use `$`, the dollar symbol. As you can see in the below example, the `$` is 
specified at the end of the pattern we are looking for.

```{r anchor_end, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_anchor_end_canva.png")
```

From our sample data set, we can see that there are 2 packages that end with
the letter `r`, dplyr and pillar.

```{r anchor_end_code}
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "r$", value = TRUE)
```
