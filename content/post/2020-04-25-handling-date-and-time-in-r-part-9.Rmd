## Intervals, Duration & Period 

```{r cline_youtube_interval, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "8LW7vSx4cew")
```

In this section, we will learn about 

- intervals
- duration
- and period

### Interval {#intervals}

An interval is a timespan defined by two date-times. Let us represent the length
of the course using `interval`. 

<br>

```{r img_course_interval, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/course_interval.png")
```

<br>

```{r lub10}
course_start    <- as_date('2017-04-12')
course_end      <- as_date('2017-04-21')
interval(course_start, course_end)
```

If you observe carefully, the interval is represented by the course start and
end dates. We will learn how to use intervals in the case study.

#### Overlapping Intervals

Let us say you are planning a vacation and want to check if the vacation
dates overlap with the course dates. You can do this by:

- creating vacation and course intervals
- use `int_overlaps()` to check if two intervals overlap. It returns `TRUE`
if the intervals overlap else `FALSE`.

Let us use the vacation start and end dates to create `vacation_interval`
and then check if it overlaps with `course_interval`. 

<br>

```{r img_intervals_overlap, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/interval_overlap.png")
```

<br>

```{r lub60, collapse = TRUE}
vacation_start    <- as_date('2017-04-19')
vacation_end      <- as_date('2017-04-25')
course_interval   <- interval(course_start, course_end)
vacation_interval <- interval(vacation_start, vacation_end)
int_overlaps(course_interval, vacation_interval)
```

#### How many invoices were settled within due date?

Let us use intervals to count the number of invoices that were settled within
the due date. To do this, we will:

- create an interval for the invoice and due date
- create a new column `due_next` by incrementing the due date by 1 day
- another interval for `due_next` and the payment date
- if the intervals overlap, the payment was made within the due date 

```{r lub7}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    due_next         = Due + days(1),
    due_pay_interval = interval(due_next, Payment),
    overlaps         = int_overlaps(inv_due_interval, due_pay_interval)
  ) %>%
  select(Invoice, Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

Below we show another method to count the number of invoices paid within the
due date. Instead of using `days` to change the due date, we use `int_shift`
to shift it by 1 day.

```{r lub12}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    due_pay_interval = interval(Due, Payment),  
    due_pay_next     = int_shift(due_pay_interval, by = days(1)),
    overlaps         = int_overlaps(inv_due_interval, due_pay_next)
  ) %>%
  select(Invoice, Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

You might be thinking why we incremented the due date by a day before creating
the interval between the due day and the payment day. If we do not increment, 
both the intervals will share a common date i.e. the due date and they will
always overlap as shown below:

```{r lub7a}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    due_pay_interval = interval(Due, Payment),
    overlaps         = int_overlaps(inv_due_interval, due_pay_interval)
  ) %>%
  select(Invoice, Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

#### Shift Interval

Intervals can be shifted too. In the below example, we shift the course 
interval by:

- 1 day
- 3 weeks
- 1 year 

<br>

```{r img_shift_interval, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/shift_interval.png")
```

<br>

```{r lab50, collapse = TRUE}
course_interval <- interval(course_start, course_end)

# shift course_interval by 1 day 
int_shift(course_interval, by = days(1))

# shift course_interval by 3 weeks
int_shift(course_interval, by = weeks(3))

# shift course_interval by 1 year
int_shift(course_interval, by = years(1))
```

### Within

Let us assume that we have to attend a conference in April 2017. Does it 
clash with the course? We can answer this using `%within%` which will
return `TRUE` if a date falls within an interval.

<br>

```{r img_within, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/within.png")
```

<br>

```{r lub30, collapse = TRUE}
conference <- as_date('2017-04-15')
conference %within% course_interval
```

#### How many invoices were settled within due date?

Let us use `%within%` to count the number of invoices that were settled within 
the due date. We will do this by:

- creating an interval for the invoice and due date
- check if the payment date falls within the above interval

```{r lub13}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    overlaps         = Payment %within% inv_due_interval
  ) %>%
  select(Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

### Duration

Duration is timespan measured in seconds. To create a duration object, use
`duration()`. The timespan can be anything from seconds to years but it will be
represented as seconds. Let us begin by creating a duration object where the timespan is in seconds.

```{r duration_1}
duration(50, "seconds")
```

Another way to specify the above timespan is shown below:

```{r duration_2}
duration(second = 50)
```

As you can see, the output is same in both the cases. Let us increase the timespan to 60 seconds and see what happens.

```{r duration_3}
duration(second = 60)
```

Although the timespan is primarily measured in seconds, it also shows `~1 minutes` in the brackets. As the length of the timespan increases i.e. the number becomes large, it is represented using larger units such as hours and days. In the below examples, as the number of seconds increases, you can observe larger units being used to represent the timespan.


```{r duration_4}
# minutes
duration(minute = 50)
duration(minute = 60)

# hours
duration(hour = 23)
duration(hour = 24)
```

The following helper functions can be used to create duration objects as well.

```{r duration_5}
# default
dseconds()
dminutes()

# seconds
duration(second = 59)
dseconds(59)

# minutes
duration(minute = 50)
dminutes(50)

# hours
duration(hour = 36)
dhours(36)

# weeks
duration(week = 56)
dweeks(56)
```

Let us use the above helper functions to get the course length in different units.

```{r img_convert, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/convert.png")
```

<br>

```{r lub11, collapse = TRUE}
# course length in seconds 
course_interval / dseconds()

# course length in minutes
course_interval / dminutes()

# course length in hours
course_interval / dhours()

# course length in weeks
course_interval / dweeks()

# course length in years
course_interval / dyears()
```

### Period

A `period` is a timespan defined in units such as years, months, and days. In
the below examples, we use `period()` to represent timespan using different
units.

```{r period_examples}
# second
period(5, "second")
period(second = 5)

# minute & second
period(c(3, 5), c("minute", "second"))
period(minute = 3, second = 5)

# hour, minte & second
period(c(1, 3, 5), c("hour", "minute", "second"))
period(hour = 1, minute = 3, second = 5)

# day, hour, minute & second
period(c(3, 1, 3, 5), c("day", "hour", "minute", "second"))
period(day = 3, hour = 1, minute = 3, second = 5)
```

<br>

```{r img_as_period, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/as_period.png")
```

<br>

Let us get the course length in different units using `as.period()`.

```{r lub17, collapse = TRUE}
# course length in second
as.period(course_interval, unit = "seconds")

# course length in hours and minutes
as.period(course_interval, unit = "minutes")

# course length in hours, minutes and seconds
as.period(course_interval, unit = "hours")
```


`time_length()` computes the exact length of a timespan i.e. `duration`, `interval` or `period`. Let us use `time_length()` to compute the length of the
course in different units.

<br>

```{r img_time_length, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/time_length.png")
```

<br>

```{r lub16, collapse = TRUE}
# course length in seconds
time_length(course_interval, unit = "seconds")

# course length in minutes
time_length(course_interval, unit = "minutes")

# course length in hours
time_length(course_interval, unit = "hours")
```
