## Introduction

This is the seventh tutorial in the series [Demystifying Regular Expressions in R](https://tutorials.rsquaredacademy.com/regex/index.html). In this tutorial, we will learn about character classes.

## Character Classes

```{r regex_character_classes, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_character_classes.png")
```

A set of characters enclosed in a square bracket (`[]`). The regular expression
will match only those characters enclosed in the brackets and it matches only a
single character. The order of the characters inside the brackets do not matter 
and a hyphen can be used to specify a range of charcters. For example, [0-9] 
will match a single digit between 0 and 9. Similarly, [a-z] will match a single 
letter between a to z. You can specify more than one range as well. [a-z0-9A-Z]
will match a alphanumeric character while ignoring the case. A caret **^** after
the opening bracket negates the character class. For example, [^0-9] will match
a single character that is not a digit.

```{r character_class_numbers, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_character_class_numbers.png")
```
Let us go through a few examples to understand character classes in more detail.

```{r character_code_1}
# package names that include vowels
grep(x = top_downloads, pattern = "[aeiou]", value = TRUE)

# package names that include a number
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "[0-9]", value = TRUE)[1:50]

# package names that begin with a number
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "^[0-9]", value = TRUE)

# package names that end with a number
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "[0-9]$", value = TRUE)[1:50]

# package names with only upper case letters
grep(x = r_packages, pattern = "^[A-Z][A-Z]{1, }[A-Z]$", value = TRUE)[1:50]
```

## Up Next..

In the next tutorial, we will work through the case studies.
