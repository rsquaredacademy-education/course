## Parse Date & Time {#parse}

```{r cline_youtube_parse, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "FqWb-OS6wu4")
```

While creating date-time objects, we specified different formats using the 
conversion specification but most often you will not create date/time and
instead deal with data that comes your way from a database or API or 
colleague/collaborator. In such cases, we need to be able to parse date/time 
from the data provided to us. In this section, we will focus on parsing 
date/time from character data. Both base R and the lubridate package offer 
functions to parse date and time and we will explore a few of them in this 
section. We will initially use functions from base R and later on explore those
from lubridate which will give us an opportunity to compare and contrast. It 
will also allow us to choose the functions based on the data we are dealing 
with.

`strptime()` will convert character data to `POSIXlt`. You will use this when
converting from character data to date/time. On the other hand, if you want to
convert date/time to character data, use any of the following:

- `strftime()`
- `format()`
- `as.character()`

The above functions will convert `POSIXct/POSIXlt` to character. Let us start
with a simple example. The data we have been supplied has date/time as 
character data and in the format `YYYYMMDD` i.e. nothing separates the year, 
month and date from each other. We will use `strptime()` to convert this to an
object of class `POSIXlt`.

```{r strptime_1}
rel_date <- strptime("20191212", format = "%Y%m%d")
class(rel_date)
```

If you have a basic knowledge of conversion specifications, you can use 
`strptime()` to convert character data to `POSIXlt`. Let us quickly explore the
functions to convert date/time to character data before moving on to the 
functions from lubridate.

```{r}
rel_date_strf <- strftime(rel_date)
class(rel_date_strf)

rel_date_format <- format(rel_date)
class(rel_date_format)

rel_date_char <- as.character(rel_date)
class(rel_date_char)
```

As you can see, all the 3 functions converted date/time to character. Time to 
move on and explore the lubridate package. We will start with an example in 
which the release date is formatted in 3 different ways but they have one thing 
in common i.e. the order in which the components appear. In all the 3 formats, 
the year is followed by the month and then the date.

To parse the release date, we will use `parse_date_time()` from lubridate which 
parses the input into `POSIXct` objects.

```{r parse_date_time}
release_date <- c("19-12-12", "20191212", "19-12 12")
parse_date_time(release_date, "ymd")
parse_date_time(release_date, "y m d")
parse_date_time(release_date, "%y%m%d")
```

Try to use `strptime()` in the above example and see what happens. Now, let us 
look at another data set. 

```{r parse_date_time_multiple}
release_date <- c("19-07-05", "2019-07-05", "05-07-2019")
```

What happens in the below case? The same date appears in multiple formats. How 
do we parse them? `parse_date_time()` allows us to specify mutiple date-time 
formats. Let us first map the dates to their formats.

```{r table_formats_pdt, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("19-07-05", "2019-07-05", "05-07-2019")
descrip <- c("`ymd`", "`ymd`", "`dmy`")
data.frame(Date = cname, Specification = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

The above specifications can be supplied as a character vector.

```{r parse_date_2}
parse_date_time(release_date, c("ymd", "ymd", "dmy"))
```

Great! We have used both `strptime()` and `parse_date_time()` now. Can you tell 
what differentiates `parse_date_time()` when compared to `strptime()`? We 
summarize it in the points below:

- no need to include `%` prefix or separator
- specify several date/time formats

There are other helper functions that can be used to 

- parse dates with only year, month, day components
- parse dates with year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds components
- parse dates with only hour, minute, second components

and are explored in the below examples.

```{r parse_ymd}
# year/month/date
ymd("2019-12-12")

# year/month/date
ymd("19/12/12")

# date/month/year
dmy(121219)

# year/month/date/hour/minute/second
ymd_hms(191212080503)

# hour/minute/second
hms("8, 5, 3")

# hour/minute/second
hms("08:05:03")

# minute/second
ms("5,3")

# hour/minute
hm("8, 5")
```

Note, in a couple of cases where the components are not separated by `/`, `-` or 
space, we have not enclosed the values in quotes. 

### Your Turn

Below, we have specified `July 5th, 2019` in different ways. Parse the dates using `strptime()` or `parse_date_time()` or any other helper function.

- `July-05-19`
- `JUL-05-19`
- `05.07.19`
- `5-July 2019`
- `July 5th, 2019`
- `July 05, 2019`
- `2019-July- 05`
- `05/07/2019`
- `07/05/2019`
- `7/5/2019`
- `07/5/19`
- `2019-07-05`
