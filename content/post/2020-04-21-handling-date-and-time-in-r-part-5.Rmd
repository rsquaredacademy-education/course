## Date & Time Formats {#formats}

```{r cline_youtube_formats, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "BdHTrItYKJw")
```

After the timezones and daylight savings detour, let us get back on path and 
explore another important aspect, date & time formats. Although it is a good 
practice to adher to ISO 8601 format, not all date/time data will comply with 
it. In real world, date/time data may come in all types of weird formats. Below
is a sample

```{r table_formats_sample, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("December 12, 2019", "12th Dec, 2019", "Dec 12th, 19", "12-Dec-19",
             "2019 December", "12.12.19") 
data.frame(Format = cname) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

When the data is not in the default ISO 8601 format, we need to explicitly 
specify the format in R. We do this using conversion specifications. A 
conversion specification is introduced by %, usually followed by a single 
letter or O or E and then a single letter. 

### Conversion Specifications

```{r table_formats_1, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`%d`", "`%m`", "`%b`", "`%B`", "`%y`", "`%Y`", "%H", "%M", "%S")
descrip <- c("Day of the month (decimal number)",
             "Month (decimal number)",
             "Month (abbreviated)",
             "Month (full name)",
             "Year (2 digit)",
             "Year (4 digit)",
             "Hour",
             "Minute",
             "Second")
example <- c(12, 12, "Dec", "December", 19, 2019, 08, 05, 03)
data.frame(Specification = cname, Description = descrip, Example = example) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

Time to work through a few examples. Let us say you are dealing with dates in 
the format `19/12/12`. In this format, the year comes first followed by month 
and the date; each separated by a slash (`/`). The year consists of only 2 
digits i.e. it does not include the century. Let us now map each component of 
the date to the conversion specification table shown at the beginning.

```{r table_formats_ex_1, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("19", "12", "12")
descrip <- c("`%y`", "`%m`", "`%d`")
data.frame(Date = cname, Specification = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

Using the format argument, we will specify the conversion specification as a character vector
i.e. enclosed in quotes.

```{r format_examples_1}
as.Date("19/12/12", format = "%y/%m/%d")
```

Another way in which the release data can be written is `2019-Dec-12`. We still 
have the year followed by the month and the date but there are a few changes 
here:

- the components are separated by a `-` instead of `/`
- year has 4 digits i.e. includes the century
- the month is specified using abbreviation instead of digits

Let us map the components to the format table:

```{r table_formats_ex_2, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("2019", "Dec", "12")
descrip <- c("`%Y`", "`%b`", "`%d`")
data.frame(Date = cname, Specification = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

Let us specify the format for the date using the above mapping.

```{r format_examples_2}
as.Date("2019-Dec-12", format = "%Y-%b-%d")
```

In both the above examples, we have not dealt with time components. Let us 
include the release time of R 3.6.2 in the next one i.e. 
`19/12/12 08:05:03`.

```{r table_formats_ex_3, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("19", "12", "12", "08", "05", "03")
descrip <- c("`%y`", "`%m`", "`%d`", "`%H`", "`%M`", "`%S`")
data.frame(Date = cname, Specification = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

Since we are dealing with time, we will use `as.POSIXct()` instead of 
`as.Date()`.

```{r format_examples_3}
as.POSIXct("19/12/12 08:05:03", tz = "UTC", format = "%y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S")
```

In the below table, we look at some of the most widely used conversion 
specifications. You can learn more about these specifications by running 
`?strptime` or `help(strptime)`.

```{r table_formats_2, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`%a`", "`%A`", "`%C`", "`%D`", "`%e`", "`%F`", "`%h`", "`%I`", "`%j`",
             "`%R`", "`%t`", "`%T`", "`%u`", "`%U`", "`%V`", "`%w`", "`%W`")
descrip <- c("Abbreviated weekday",
             "Full weekday",
             "Century (00-99)",
             "Same as `%m/%d/%y`",
             "Day of month [1 - 31]",
             "Same as `%Y-%m-%d`",
             "Same as `%b`",
             "Hours as decimal [01 - 12]",
             "Day of year [001 - 366]",
             "Same as `%H:%M`",
             "Tab",
             "Same as `%H:%M:%S`",
             "Weekday [1 - 7](Monday is 1)",
             "Week of year [00 - 53]",
             "Week of year [01 - 53]",
             "Weekday [0 - 6](sunday is 0)",
             "Week of year [00 - 53]")
data.frame(Specification = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

We have included a lot of practice questions for you to explore the different 
date/time formats. The solutions are available in the Learning Management System 
as well as in our GitHub repo. Try them and let us know if you have any doubts.

### Guess Format

`guess_formats()` from lubridate is a very useful function. It will guess the 
date/time format if you specify the order in which year, month, date, hour, 
minute and second appear.

```{r guess_formats}
release_date_formats <- c("December 12th 2019",
                        "Dec 12th 19",
                        "dec 12 2019")

guess_formats(release_date_formats, 
              orders = "mdy", 
              print_matches = TRUE)
```

### Your Turn

Below, we have specified `July 5th, 2019` in different ways. Create the date using `as.Date()` while specifying the correct format for each of them.

- `05.07.19`
- `5-July 2019`
- `July 5th, 2019`
- `July 05, 2019`
- `2019-July- 05`
- `05/07/2019`
- `07/05/2019`
- `7/5/2019`
- `07/5/19`
- `2019-07-05`
