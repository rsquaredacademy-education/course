## Create, Update & Verify {#createupdate}

```{r cline_youtube_verify, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

```

In the second section, we learnt to create date-time objects using `as.Date()`, 
`as.POSIXct()` etc. In this section, we will explore a few other functions that 
will allow us to do the same

- `make_date()`
- `make_datetime()`

### Create

To create date without time components, use `make_date()` and specify the 
following:

- year
- month
- date

We need to specify all the components in numbers i.e. we cannot use `Dec` or 
`December` for the month. It has to be `12`.

```{r make_date}
make_date(year  = 2019,
          month = 12,
          day   = 12)
```

When you need to include time components, use `make_datetime()`.

```{r make_datetime}
make_datetime(year  = 2019,
              month = 12,
              day   = 12,
              hour  = 08,
              min   = 05,
              sec   = 03,
              tz    = "UTC")
```

### Update

Let us look at another scenario. You have a date-time object and want to change 
one of its components i.e. any of the following

- year
- month
- date

Instead of creating another date-time object, you can change any of the 
components using `update()`. In the below example, we will start with the date 
of release of R version 3.6.1 and using `update()`, we will change it to
`2019-12-12`.

```{r update}
prev_release <- ymd("2019-07-05")
prev_release %>% 
  update(year  = 2019,
         month = 12,
         mday  = 12)
```

### Date Sequence

So far we have created a single date-time instance. How about creating a 
sequence of dates? We can do that using `seq.Date()`. We need to specify the 
from date as the bare minimum input. If the end date is not specified, it will 
create the sequence uptil the current date.

The interval of the sequence can be specified in any of the following units:

- day
- week
- month
- quarter
- year

We can add the following to the interval units

- integer
- `+` / `-` (increment or decrement)

Using the integer, we can specify multiples of the units mentioned and using the 
sign, we can specify whether to increment or decrement.

The below table displays the main arguments used in `seq.Date()`:

```{r table_seq_date, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`from`", "`by`", "`to`", "`length.out`", "`along.with`")
descrip <- c("Starting date of the sequence", "End date of the sequence", 
             "Date increment of the sequence", "Length of the sequence",
             "Use length of this value as length of sequence")
data.frame(Function = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

In the first example, we will create a sequence of dates from `2010-01-01` to 
`2019-12-31`. The unit of increment should be a year i.e. the difference
between the dates in the sequence should be 1 year, specified using the `by` 
argument.

```{r seq_date_1}
seq.Date(from = as.Date("2010-01-01"), to = as.Date("2019-12-31"), by = "year")
```

In the next example, we change the unit of increment to a quarter i.e. the 
difference between the dates in the sequence should be a quarter or 3 months.

```{r seq_date_2}
seq.Date(from = as.Date("2009-12-12"), to = as.Date("2019-12-12"), by = "quarter")
```

We will now create a sequence of dates but instead of specifying the unit of 
increment, we specify the number of dates in the sequence i.e. the length of the
sequence. We do this using the `length.out` argument which specifies the desired
length of the sequence. We want the sequence to have 10 dates including the
start and end date, and hence we supply the value `10` for the `length.out` 
argument.

```{r seq_date_3}
seq.Date(from = as.Date("2010-01-01"), to = as.Date("2019-12-31"), length.out = 10)
```

In all of the previous examples, we have specified both the start and the end
date. Let us look at a few examples where we create a sequence of dates where 
we only specify the start date. In the below example, we want to create a 
sequence of dates starting from `2010-01-01`. The unit of increment should be 1
year i.e. the difference between the dates in the sequence should be 1 year and
the length of the sequence should be `10` i.e. the number of dates including the
start date should be `10`.

```{r seq_date_4}
seq.Date(from = as.Date("2010-01-01"), by = "year", length.out = 10)
```

The unit of increment can include multiples and `+/-` sign i.e. it can be an
unit of increment or decrement. In the next example, we can increment the dates
in the sequence by `2` i.e. the difference between the dates should be `2`
instead of `1`. This is achieved by specifying the unit of increment (multiple)
first followed by a space and then the unit. In our example, it is `2 year`. As
you can see, the sequence now goes all the way till `2028` and the gap between 
the dates is 2 years.

```{r seq_date_5}
seq.Date(from = as.Date("2010-01-01"), by = "2 year", length.out = 10)
```

Let us say instead of increment we want to decrement the dates i.e. the sequence 
of dates will go backwards as shown in the next example. We achieve this by 
using the `-` sign along with the unit of decrement. The sequence of dates in 
next example starts from `2010` and goes back upto `1992` and the difference 
between the dates in 2 years.

```{r seq_date_6}
seq.Date(from = as.Date("2010-01-01"), by = "-2 year", length.out = 10)
```

In the last example, we will explore the `along.with` argument. Here we have 
supplied a vector which is a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10. The length of 
this vector is 10 and the same length is used as the length of the sequence i.e. 
the length of value supplied to `along.with` is also the length of the sequence.

```{r seq_date_7}
seq.Date(from = as.Date("2010-01-01"), by = "-2 year", along.with = 1:10)
```

### Verify Type

How do you check if the data is a date-time object? You can do that using any 
of the following from the lubridate package.

- `is.Date()`
- `is.POSIXct()`
- `is.POSIXlt()`

```{r check_release_date_type, echo=FALSE}
release_date <- ymd_hms("2019-12-12 08:05:03")
```

```{r check_type}
is.Date(release_date)
is.POSIXct(release_date)
is.POSIXlt(release_date)
```

### Your Turn

- R 2.0.0 was released on `2004-10-04 14:24:38`. Create this date using both
`make_date()` and `make_datetime()`

- R 3.0.0 was released on `2013-04-03 07:12:36`. Update the date created in the
previous step to the above using `update()`
