## Introduction

In this post, we will learn about using regular expressions in R. While it is 
aimed at absolute beginners, we hope experienced users will find it useful as 
well. The post is broadly divided into 3 sections. In the first section, we 
will introduce the pattern matching functions such as `grep`, `grepl` etc. in 
base R as we will be using them in the rest of the post. Once the reader is 
comfortable with the above mentioned pattern matching functions, we will 
learn about regular expressions while exploring the names of R packages by 
probing the following:

- how many package names include the letter `r`?
- how many package names begin or end with the letter `r`?
- how many package names include the words `data` or `plot`?

In the final section, we will go through 4 case studies including simple email
validation. If you plan to try the case studies, please do not skip any of the
topics in the second section. 

## RStudio Addin

<a href="https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/" target="_blank">Garrick Aden-Buie</a> 
has created a wonderful RStudio addin, <a href="https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/regexplain/" target="_blank">RegExplain</a> 
and you will find it very useful while learning and building regular expressions. 

## Other Applications

- R variable names
- R file names and extensions
- password validation
- camelcase
- currency format
- date of birth
- date validation
- decimal number
- full name / first name
- html tags
- https url 
- phone number 
- ip address 
- month name

## What we have not covered?

While we have covered a lot, the below topics have been left out:

- flags
- grouping and capturing
- back references
- look ahead and look behind

You may want to explore them to up your regular expressions game.

## Summary

- a regular expression is a special text for identifying a pattern
- it can be used to search, replace, validate and extract strings matching a 
given pattern
- use cases include email and password validation, search and replace in text
editors, html tags validation, web scraping etc.
