## Libraries

Before we connect to and explore the local SQLite database, let us take a look at the R packages we will use in this post. 

- [DBI](http://r-dbi.github.io/DBI/) a database interface for R 
- [config](https://cran.r-project.org/package=config) for handling credentials

```{r load_libs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages(c("DBI", "dbplyr", "dplyr", "dbplot", "ggplot2", "modeldb",
# "tidypredict", "config"))
library(DBI)
library(config)
```

If you do not have all the above packages installed, go ahead and install them. In the R script we are sharing with you, we have commented out the code for installing the packages. If you are using the RStudio Cloud project, we have already installed the packages in the project and you can just load them into the R session using `library()`. 

As and when we come to the specific sections where we are using these packages, they will be reintroduced and we will look at their documentation and explore the functions we will use.

## Handling Credentials

Handling database credentials is one of the most important part of working with
databases in R. In this section, we will look at the different options for 
securely storing and accessing credentials. After connecting to the database, we
will list the tables in the database (just to check that the connection is 
working) and then disconnect.

## rstudioapi

You can prompt the user to enter the database credentials using RStudio IDE. `askForPassword()` will show a popup box that masks what is typed.

```{r cred_2, eval=FALSE}
db_con <- DBI::dbConnect(drv      = RMySQL::MySQL(), 
                         username = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database Username"),
                         password = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database Password"),
                         host     = "mysql-ecom.cowqoftkc0gy.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com", 
                         port     = 3306, 
                         dbname   = "mysql_test")
```

```{r dbi_ask_credentials, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/dbi_ask_credentials.png")
```


#### .Renviron

The second method is store the credentials as environment variables. This can
be achieved using `Sys.setenv()` or using .Renviron file. The credentials can then be retrieved using `Sys.getenv()` as shown in the below example:

```{r cred_3, eval=FALSE}
db_con <- DBI::dbConnect(drv      = RMySQL::MySQL(), 
                         username = Sys.getenv("db_uid"), 
                         password = Sys.getenv("db_pwd"), 
                         host     = "mysql-ecom.cowqoftkc0gy.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com", 
                         port     = 3306, 
                         dbname   = "mysql_test")

# list tables in the database
DBI::dbListTables(db_con)
DBI::dbDisconnect(db_con)
```

In RStudio, create a new file and save it as .Renviron. In this file, define the
credentials as shown below:

```{r renv_cred, eval=FALSE}
userid = "username"
pwd    = "password"
```

Save the file in the home directory of your project and restart R. Why should you restart R? .Renviron is processed only at the beginning of an R session. If you try to access the credentials using `Sys.getenv()` without restarting R, the credentials will not be retrieved and you will see an error if you try to connect to the database. After restarting R, use `Sys.getenv()` to retrieve the
credentials while opening a new connection to the database. We have added the `.Renviron` file used to store credentials in the resources section of the learning management system as well as in the GitHub repo.

#### options

The database credentials can be recorded as a global option in R. There are two ways to do this:

- use `options()`
- use an R file

Below is the code that records credentials using `options()`:

```{r options_example}
options(db_userid   = "user_id")
options(db_password = "pass_word")
```

The above code can be stored in a R file which can then be sourced before opening a new connection to the database. The credentials can be retrieved using `getOptions()`. We have added the `options.R` file used to store credentials to the database in the resources section of the learning management system as well as in the GitHub repo.

```{r cred_4, eval=FALSE}
source("options.R")
db_con <- DBI::dbConnect(drv      = RMySQL::MySQL(), 
                         username = getOption("db_userid"), 
                         password = getOption("db_password"), 
                         host     = "mysql-ecom.cowqoftkc0gy.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com", 
                         port     = 3306, 
                         dbname   = "mysql_test")

# list tables in the database
DBI::dbListTables(db_con)
DBI::dbDisconnect(db_con)
```

#### config

The [config](https://github.com/rstudio/config) package allows you to manage environment specific configuration values. Configurations are defined using a YAML text file and are read by default from a file named config.yml in the current working directory. Store the database connection details such as driver, username, password, host, port, database name etc. in a YAML file and read it using `get()`. We have added the `config.yml` file used to store the credentials in the resources section of the learning management system as well as in the GitHub repo.

```{r cred_5, eval=FALSE}
# read configurations
md <- config::get("mysql-dev")

# test
md$port
md$dbname

# connect
db_con <- DBI::dbConnect(drv      = RMySQL::MySQL(), 
                         username = md$username,
                         password = md$password,
                         host     = md$host, 
                         port     = md$port, 
                         dbname   = md$dbname)

# list tables in the database
DBI::dbListTables(db_con)
DBI::dbDisconnect(db_con)
```


#### keyring

The [keyring](https://github.com/r-lib/keyring#readme) package provides platform independent API to access the operating systems credential store. We leave it to the reader to explore the keyring package for storing and accessing credentials safely.

## dbx

[dbx](https://github.com/ankane/dbx) is another interesting package built on top
of DBI for both research and production environments and we hope to explore it 
in a separate post in the coming days.
