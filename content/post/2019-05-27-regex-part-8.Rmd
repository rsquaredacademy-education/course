## Introduction

In this post, we will learn about using regular expressions in R. While it is 
aimed at absolute beginners, we hope experienced users will find it useful as 
well. The post is broadly divided into 3 sections. In the first section, we 
will introduce the pattern matching functions such as `grep`, `grepl` etc. in 
base R as we will be using them in the rest of the post. Once the reader is 
comfortable with the above mentioned pattern matching functions, we will 
learn about regular expressions while exploring the names of R packages by 
probing the following:

- how many package names include the letter `r`?
- how many package names begin or end with the letter `r`?
- how many package names include the words `data` or `plot`?

In the final section, we will go through 4 case studies including simple email
validation. If you plan to try the case studies, please do not skip any of the
topics in the second section. 

## Case Studies

Now that we have understood the basics of regular expressions, it is time for 
some practical application. The case studies in this section include validating 
the following:

- blood group
- email id
- PAN number
- GST number

Note, the regular expressions used here are not robust as compared to those 
used in real world applications. Our aim is to demonstrate a general strategy
to used while dealing with regular expressions. 

### Blood Group

According to Wikipedia, a blood group or type is a classification of blood based 
on the presence and absence of antibodies and inherited antigenic substances on 
the surface of red blood cells (RBCs).

```{r regex_bg_validation, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_cs_blood_groups.png")
```

The below table defines the matching pattern for blood group and maps them to
regular expressions. 

- it must begin with `A`, `B`, `AB` or `O`
- it must end with `+` or `-`

```{r regex_bg_table, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_cs_bg_table.png")
```

Let us test the regular expression with some examples.

```{r blood_group}
blood_pattern <- "^(A|B|AB|O)[-|+]$"
blood_sample <- c("A+", "C-", "AB+")
grep(x = blood_sample, pattern = blood_pattern, value = TRUE)
```

### email id

Nowadays email is ubiquitous. We use it for everything from communication to 
registration for online services. Wherever you go, you will be asked for email 
id. You might even be denied a few services if you do not use email. At the same
time, it is important to validate a email address. You might have seen a message
similar to the below one when you misspell or enter a wrong email id. Regular
expressions are used to validate email address and in this case study we will 
attempt to do the same.

```{r regex_email_validation, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_cs_email.png")
```

First, we will create some basic rules for simple email validation:

- it must begin with a letter
- the id may include letters, numbers and special characters
- must include only one @ and dot
- the id must be to the left of @
- the domain name should be between @ and dot
- the domain extension should be after dot and must include only letters

In the below table, we map the above rules to general expression.

```{r regex_email_table, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_cs_email_table.png")
```

Let us now test the regular expression with some dummy email ids.

```{r email_validation}
email_pattern <- "^[a-zA-Z0-9\\!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\.[a-z]"
emails <- c("test9+_A@test.com", "test@test..com", "test-test.com")
grep(x = emails, pattern = email_pattern, value = TRUE)
```

### PAN Number Validation

PAN (Permanent Account Number) is an identification number assigned to all 
taxpayers in India. PAN is an electronic system through which, all tax related 
information for a person/company is recorded against a single PAN number.

#### Structure

- must include only 10 characters
- the first 5 characters are letters
- the next 4 characters are numerals
- the last character is a letter

```{r regex_pan_validation_1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_cs_pan_1.png")
```

- the first 3 characters are a sequence from AAA to ZZZ
- the 4th character indicates the status of the tax payer and shold be one of
A, B, C, F, G, H, L, J, P, T or E
- the 5th character is the first character of the last/surname of the card holder
- the 6th to 10th character is a sequnce from 0001 to 9999
- the last character is a letter

```{r regex_pan_validation_2, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_cs_pan_2.png")
```

In the below table, we map the pattern to regular expression.

```{r regex_pan_table, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_cs_pan_table.png")
```

Let us test the regular expression with some dummy PAN numbers.

```{r pan_validation}
pan_pattern <- "^[A-Z]{3}(A|B|C|F|G|H|L|J|P|T|E)[A-Z][0-9]{4}[A-Z]"
my_pan <- c("AJKNT3865H", "AJKNT38655", "A2KNT3865H", "AJKDT3865H")
grep(x = my_pan, pattern = pan_pattern, value = TRUE)
```

### GST Number Validation

In simple words, Goods and Service Tax (GST) is an indirect tax levied on the 
supply of goods and services. This law has replaced many indirect tax laws that 
previously existed in India. GST identification number is assigned to every
GST registed dealer.

```{r regex_gst_validation, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_cs_gst.png")
```

#### Structure

Below is the format break down of GST identification number:

- it must include 15 characters only
- the first 2 characters represent the state code and is a sequence from 01 to 35
- the next 10 characters are the PAN number of the entity
- the 13th character is the entity code and is between 1 and 9
- the 14th character is a default alphabet, **Z**
- the 15th character is a random single number or alphabet

In the below table, we map the pattern to regular expression.

```{r regex_gst_table, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/regex_cs_gst_table.png")
```

Let us test the regular expression with some dummy GST numbers.

```{r gst_validation}
gst_pattern <- "[0-3][1-5][A-Z]{3}(A|B|C|F|G|H|L|J|P|T|E)[A-Z][0-9]{4}[A-Z][1-9]Z[0-9A-Z]"
sample_gst <- c("22AAAAA0000A1Z5", "22AAAAA0000A1Z", "42AAAAA0000A1Z5",
                "38AAAAA0000A1Z5", "22AAAAA0000A0Z5", "22AAAAA0000A1X5",
                "22AAAAA0000A1Z$")
grep(x = sample_gst, pattern = gst_pattern, value = TRUE)
```
