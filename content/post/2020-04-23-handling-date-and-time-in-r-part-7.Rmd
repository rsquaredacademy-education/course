```

## Date & Time Components {#components}

```{r cline_youtube_components, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "88iUo0Z06ZI")
```

In the second section, we discussed the downside of saving date/time as 
character/string in R. One of the points we discussed was that we can't extract 
components such as year, month, day etc. In this section, we will learn to 
extract date/time components such as

- year
- month
- date
- week
- day
- quarter
- semester
- hour
- minute
- second
- timezone

```{r img_day_week_month, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('/img/day_week_month.png')
```

The below table outlines the functions we will explore in the first part of this
section. 

```{r table_components_1, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`year()`", "`month()`", "`month(label = TRUE)`", 
             "`month(abbr = FALSE)`", "`months()`", "`week()`")
descrip <- c("Get year", "Get month (number)", "Get month (abbreviated name)", 
             "Get month (full name)", "Get month", "Get week")
data.frame(Function = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```


### Year

```{r year}
release_date <- ymd_hms("2019-12-12 08:05:03")
year(release_date) 
```

### Month

`month()` will return the month as a number i.e. `12` for December. 

```{r month_1}
month(release_date)
```

Instead, if you want the name of the month , use the `label` argument and set it 
to `TRUE`. Now it returns `Dec` instead of `12`.

```{r month_2}
month(release_date, label = TRUE)
```

But this is the abbreviated name and not the full name. How do we get the full 
name of the month? Set the `abbr` argument to `FALSE`. 

```{r month_3}
month(release_date, label = TRUE, abbr  = FALSE)
```

Ah! now we can see the full name of the month. `months()` from base R will 
return the full name of the month by default. If you want the abbreviated name, 
use the `abbreviate` argument and set it to `TRUE`.

```{r month_4}
months(release_date)
```

### Week

`week()` returns the number of complete 7 day periods between the date and 1st 
January plus one. 

```{r week}
week(release_date)
```

### Day

Use `day()` to extract the date component. There are other variations such as

```{r table_components_2, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`day`", "`mday()`", "`wday()`", "`qday()`", "`yday()`", 
             "`weekdays()`", "`days_in_month()`")
descrip <- c("Get day", "Day of the month", "Day of the week", "Day of quarter",
             "Day of year", "Day of week", "Days in the month")
data.frame(Function = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

```{r day_1}
day(release_date)
mday(release_date)                 
qday(release_date)                 
yday(release_date)                 
```

`wday` can return

- a number
- abbreviation of the weekday
- full name of the weekday

```{r day_2}
wday(release_date)  
wday(release_date, label = TRUE)
wday(release_date, label = TRUE, abbr  = FALSE)  
```

`weekdays()` from base R also returns the day of the week (the name and not 
the number). If you want the abbreviated name, use the `abbreviate` argument.

```{r day_3}
weekdays(release_date)
weekdays(release_date, abbreviate = TRUE)
```

### Days in Month

If you want to know the number of days in the month, use `days_in_month()`. 
In our example, the month is December and it has 31 days.

```{r days_in_month}
days_in_month(release_date)
```

### Hour, Minute & Seconds

```{r table_components_3, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`hour()`", "`minute()`", "`second()`", "`seconds()`")
descrip <- c("Get hour", "Get minute", "Get second", 
             "Number of seconds since `1970-01-01`")
data.frame(Function = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

So far we have been looking at date components. Now, let us look at time 
components.

```{r hour_min_sec_tz}
hour(release_date)
minute(release_date)
second(release_date)
```

`seconds()` returns the number of seconds since `1970-01-01`.

```{r hour_min_seconds}
seconds(release_date)
```

### Quarter & Semester

```{r img_quarter_semester, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('/img/quarter_semester.png')
```

`quarter()` will return the quarter from the date. December is in the 4th 
quarter and hence it returns 4. 

```{r quarter_1}
quarter(release_date)
```

If you want the year along with the quarter, set the `with_year` argument to 
`TRUE`.

```{r quarter_2}
quarter(release_date, with_year = TRUE)
```

In India, the fiscal starts in April and December falls in the 3rd quarter. How 
can we accommodate this change? The `fiscal_start` argument allows us to set the 
month in which the fiscal begins. We will set it to 4 for April. Now it returns 
3 instead of 4.

```{r quarter_3}
quarter(release_date, fiscal_start = 4)    
```

`quarters()` from base R also returns the quarter.

```{r quarter_4}
quarters(release_date)
```

```{r table_components_4, echo=FALSE}
cname   <- c("`quarter()`", "`quarter(with_year = TRUE)`", 
             "`quarter(fiscal_start = 4)`", "`quarters()`", "`semester()`")
descrip <- c("Get quarter", "Quarter with year", "Fiscal starts in April",
             "Get quarter", "Get semester")
data.frame(Function = cname, Description = descrip) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")
  )
```

### Case Study

#### Extract Date, Month & Year from Due Date

Let us now extract the date, month and year from the `Due` column.

```{r lub2}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    due_day   = day(Due),
    due_month = month(Due),
    due_year  = year(Due)
  )
```

#### Data Sanitization

Let us do some data sanitization. If the due day happens to be February 29, 
let us ensure that the due year is a leap year. Below are the steps to check 
if the due year is a leap year:

- we will extract the following from the due date:
    - day
    - month
    - year
- we will then create a new column `is_leap` which will have be set to `TRUE` if 
the year is a leap year else it will be set to `FALSE` 
- filter all the payments due on 29th Feb
- select the following columns:
    - `Due`
    - `is_leap`

```{r lub6}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    due_day   = day(Due),
    due_month = month(Due),
    due_year  = year(Due),
    is_leap   = leap_year(due_year)
  ) %>%
  filter(due_month == 2 & due_day == 29) %>%
  select(Due, is_leap) 
```

#### Invoices Distribution by Quarter

Let us count the invoices due for each quarter.

```{r lub8}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    quarter_due = quarter(Due)
  ) %>%
  count(quarter_due)
```

### Your Turn

Get the R release dates using `r_versions()` from the **rversions** package and
tabulate the following

- year 
- month with label
- weekday with label
- hour
- and quarter
